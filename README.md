# Memory Cards

## Introduction

According to research described by Felienne Hermans (https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felienne_Hermans) in her book 
`The programmer's brain` (https://www.manning.com/books/the-programmers-brain), reading code is one of the undervalued skills programmers need to be good at their job. In the book she describes how reference cards may help to memorize syntax and concepts. 
Memorizing syntax makes programmers more effective because it saves time searching the internet (and avoids the dreaded time sink the internet can be). 
So I set out to write some memory cards: write a concept on one side and its explaination (or rather, a small code snippet) on the other side. This is boring of course, so I stripped an example from a training on CSS and SASS by Jonas Schmedtmann and created this repository. 
It should, at some point in the future, hold a list of lists of question/answer pairs that can be studied, preferably on a mobile phone.
